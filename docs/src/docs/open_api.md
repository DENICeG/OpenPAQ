## Compatibility and Backwards Compatibility Commitment

To ensure a smooth transition for our users, we commit to maintaining backwards compatibility with previous versions (e.g. v2) until we can safely deprecate them.

We will support the old API endpoints for at least 6 months after releasing a new stable version (v3). 

During this period, we will clearly mark deprecated API endpoints in the API documentation and change logs, so users are aware of upcoming changes. 

Our goal is to minimize disruptions and ensure a seamless experience for our users.
